3) docker run -p80:3000 --env colour="Red" --env message="Hello There" co328/lab2/app2

4) docker run -p80:3000 --env colour="Yellow" --env message="Hello There" co328/lab2/app3
       (Here co328/lab2/app3 means the tag I gave to the created image)



6) Unable to access the previously uploaded picture. 
A Docker image is a collection of read-only layers. When we launch a container from an image, Docker adds a read-write layer to the top of that stack of read-only layers.
Anytime a file changed,Docker makes a copy of the file from the read-only layers up into the top read-write layer. This laeves the original(read-only) file unchanged.
When a container is deleted, that top read-write layer is lost.
So any changes made after the container was launched will be gone.
 (If our application need to retain data, most common way is Docker volume.)



7) docker volume create --name app4-volume
   docker run -it --name app4-data -p80:3000 -v app4-volume:/upload co328/lab2/app4
